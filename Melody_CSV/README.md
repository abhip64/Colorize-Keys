# KEY ORDERING IN CSV FILE

The keyboard i have used has a total of 5 octaves. The notes are ordered from the leftmost key(being C of first octave) to the rightmost key(C of 6th octave). The time division in the csv file is based on the minimum length
of key stroke. The current implemented song is Thousand Years by Christina Perri.
